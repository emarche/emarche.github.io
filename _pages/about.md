I am a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="https://www.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> advised by <a href="https://priyadonti.com/">Prof. Priya Donti</a>, in the <a href="https://lids.mit.edu">Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems</a>. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Associate with <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/chris-amato/">Prof. Christopher Amato</a> at <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</a>, and a Ph.D. student at the University of Verona, with <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli">Prof. Alessandro Farinelli</a>.

My <strong>research interests</strong> are driven by the impact that reinforcement learning (RL) could have in the real-world, where effective <em>exploration</em>, <em>safety</em>, and <em>asynchronous execution</em> are key requirements for autonomous agents. Hence, I focus on developing deep RL algorithms aimed at tackling these fundamental challenges in simulation, <em>multi-agent</em> systems, and realistic applications. I am currently working on safe and asynchronous multi-agent RL and will focus on its applications to power systems during my Postdoc. 

Outside of work, I spend time climbing and hiking.
