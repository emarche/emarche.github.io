&emsp;**December**
- I’m thrilled to share that I’ve been awarded a <a href='https://fis-submission.mur.gov.it'>Fondo Italiano per la Scienza (FIS 3)</a> Starting Grant funded by the Italian Ministry of Universities and Research (MUR) for my 5-year project, “Real-World Autonomous Agents through Trustworthy Reinforcement Learning.” This funding will allow me to kickstart my research lab, focusing on developing cooperative and trustworthy RL agents for real-world deployment. The project aims to lay down the foundations of RL methods for complex and realistic settings, including robotic warehouses and power grids ⚙️⚡, where agents must operate under partial information, collaborate with humans and other agents 🤝, and provide formal safety guarantees 🛡️

&emsp;**November**
- <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3770068'>“Verifying Online Safety Properties for Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning”</a> is finally published in ACM TIST and starts to investigate how to combine verification approaches for improving the safety of RL agents.

&emsp;**September**
- Our work <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11117187'>“Designing Control Barrier Function via Probabilistic Enumeration for Safe Reinforcement Learning Navigation”</a> has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.

&emsp;**January**
- <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3709347.3743780'>“Improving Policy Optimization via ε-Retrain”</a> investigates how to improve an agent's safety and performance by retraining from unsafe states visited at training time. Check it out at AAMAS 2025.
- Our latest work fixing multi-agent value factorization formalization, <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3709347.3743778'>“On Stateful Value Factorization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”</a> has also been accepted at AAMAS 2025.
- A new collaboration with  <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/alp-aydeniz'>Alp Aydeniz</a>, <a href='https://sheffield.ac.uk/cs/people/academic/robert-loftin'>Robert Loftin</a>, <a href='http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/camato/'>Christopher Amato</a>, and <a href='https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~ktumer/'>Kagan Tumer</a> has been accepted at AAMAS 2025. Check out our abstract <a href='https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2025/pdfs/p2411.pdf'>“Safe Entropic Agents under Team Constraints”</a>!
