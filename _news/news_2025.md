&emsp;**November**
- <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3770068'>“Verifying Online Safety Properties for Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning”</a> is finally published in ACM TIST and starts to investigate how to combine verification approaches for improving the safety of RL agents.

&emsp;**September**
- Our work <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11117187'>“Designing Control Barrier Function via Probabilistic Enumeration for Safe Reinforcement Learning Navigation”</a> has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.

&emsp;**January**
- <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3709347.3743780'>“Improving Policy Optimization via ε-Retrain”</a> investigates how to improve an agent's safety and performance by retraining from unsafe states visited at training time. Check it out at AAMAS 2025.
Our work <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15381'>“On Stateful Value Factorization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”</a> has been accepted at AAMAS 2025.
- Our latest work fixing multi-agent value factorization formalization, <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3709347.3743778'>“On Stateful Value Factorization in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning”</a> has also been accepted at AAMAS 2025.
